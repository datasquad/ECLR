There is a plethora of resources if you want to learn R (which is one reason why this resource does not go into too much detail). Here are a few places to start.

* A dedicated tweet channel for [Econometrics with R](https://twitter.com/Rstats4Econ)
* [Rob Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/publications/software/) has great material, some of which will be referred to here.
* My colleague [Junanjo Medina](http://jjmedinaariza.github.io/R-for-Criminologists/) has material for criminologists that includes good intros to graphing and some basic statistics
* [A Beginner's Guide to R](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2497143/business-intelligence-beginner-s-guide-to-r-introduction.html?null)
* Florian Heiss has written an R [companion book to Wooldridge's Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/read/mobile/index.html#p=1). It is available for free online but you can also get a [hardcopy](http://www.urfie.net/index.html) 
* Some R resources provided by[UCLA](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/)
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net) web-site.
