# Introduction

Measuring economic activity is a rather tricky business. Most of us are familiar with gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of economic activity. It's strengths and weaknesses are well known. One particular issue with any national statistics like GDP but also for instance industrial production, is that their production requires the full might of National Statistical Authorities. 

It therefore seems attractive to consider using measures of academic activity that do

The R code in this post is mainly based on the code shared by:

# File upload

When you are working with an existing datafile on your computer, then you should first ensure that you have set your working directory such that it points to the folder from which you are working and where you can find your datafile. Let's assume that you have saved [mroz.csv](https://github.com/datasquad/ECLR/blob/gh-pages/data/Mroz.csv){target="_blank"} to your working directory: `C:\Rwork`. Then the command below should read `setwd("C:/Rwork")`. Note that all backward slashes (`\`) have to be replaced by forward slashes (`/`). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("XXXX:/XXXX")   # replace the XXXX with your drive and path
```

The datafile we practice with here is a comma separated values file (csv). To upload such a file we use the `read.csv` function as follows, assuming that the data file is in the working directory:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("mroz.csv")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("data/Mroz.csv")
```


This loads the data (753 observations and 22 variables), as a new object called `mydata` into your environment. Check in your environment window to confirm that it is there. 

A typical erorr message at this stage is "Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection". If you get that error message this is an indicatin that the datafile you are intending to upload is not in the working directory. You can check what the current working directory is with `getwd()` in the console. Make sure that file location and working directory are synchronised.

If you use the help function (`?read.csv` in the console) you will find some guidance in the use of this function.

As you can see there are a lot of options you can set. One which is often important to use is the `na.strings` option. Here you are telling R how missing values are coded up in the spreadsheet you are uploading.

Let's see why this is important. You can get a first glimpse at the data using the `str()` function. This is useful as it gives you the datatypes.

```{r}
str(mydata)
```

Most of the data are of the `num` (numeric) and `int` (integer) type, but two variables (`wage` and `lwage`) come as character/text (`chr`) variables. This is awkwar as we are likely to want to use these data (here wages) for some numerical analysis. Why did R not recognise these numbers as numbers?

To see that, here is an excerpt of the file we just uploaded:

![Example for missing data](images/csvex.png){width=50%}

You can see that in the wage column there are some observations which do not have a number but rather a ".". This is this spreadsheet's way of telling you that for these observations there is no wage information. The information is missing. Different spreadsheets code missing values in different ways. Sometimes it will just be empty cells, sometimes it will say "NA" or "na". You need to help R to recognise missing values. That is what the `na.strings` option in the `read.csv` function does.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("mroz.csv", na.strings = ".")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("data/Mroz.csv", na.strings = ".")
```

You can now test with `str(mydata)` to confirm that the `wage` and `lwage` data are now recognised as numeric data.

If your data come as an excel file ([mroz.xlsx](https://datasquad.github.io/ECLR/Data/mroz.xlsx)), then we need to use a different function. There are, as always, different functions which do the same job. We recommend `read_excel` which comes from the `readxl` package (needs loading!). Note that the option to indicate how missing values are coded is here called `na`.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
mydata <- read_excel("Mroz.xlsx", na = ".")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
mydata <- read_excel("data/Mroz.xlsx", na = ".")
```
