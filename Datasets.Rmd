## Greater Manchester accident data ([STATS19_GM_AccData.csv](https://datasquad.github.io/ECLR/Data/STATS19_GM_AccData.csv))

In this dataset you can find data on each police-registered road traffic accident in Greater Manchester (UK) between 2010 and 2020. The government provides detailed data on these. The datafile comes from the [Government Data website](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/25170a92-0736-4090-baea-bf6add82d118/gm-road-casualty-accidents-full-stats19-data). From this link you can download the latest dataset. The file linked above contains data from 2010 to 2020.

The dataset contains information on more than 40,000 accidents. On each accident there are 25 pieces of information (variables). The data are the coded up information drawn from accident reports. In order to understand how the variables are coded you should have the [Data Dictionary](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995422/stats19.pdf) at hand.
